                <p>
                    I am currently attending KU Coding Bootcamp to develop skills necessary to become a Web Developer. For 3+ years, I have worked
                    as an occupational therapy assistant in skilled nursing facilities. Over those years, I realized that I wanted a
                    career that offered more creativity, a greater challenge, and the opportunity to grow within my career. I am excited
                    to tackle the challenges I encounter during this journey into Web Development! It is both thrilling and scary to
                    take the leap into a career I will enjoy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When researching careers, one of the factors I appreciated about learning to code was that it was like learning a new language!
                    I've always wanted to learn a new language, and it is appealing to me that I can learn a new language and create
                    something in the process!
                </p>
